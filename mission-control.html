											<h2 class="major"><span>Welcome, Freelancer Captain.</span></h2>
											<p>AVAX-pelago has fallen to the FIATland foreign occupiers, the grand AVAX Navy has been destroyed in the final battle and the regional government has capitulated. AVAXpelago enters into a new chapter as the populance decides on whether they submit to the FIATland way of life or resist and work towards liberation. As a freelance captain, this is a prime time for you to make a fortune.
											<br><br>Battles are fought with $SHIP tokens which are generated every month based on the # of island and shipyards you have. Win missions to earn $RP, Resource Points, to power up your fleet, the resistance movement and make major breakthroughs against the FIATland occupation.</p>

						<p>Things have changed a lot since then. The FIATland armada has moved on to the Fantom region and left behind a modest garrison to bring about stability in the region. We no longer build ships from a centralized location but instead individual islands are building ships in a decentralized manner at their <a href="https://avaxnavies.com">local shipyards</a>. Battles/mission will be determined by $SHIP tokens with rewards coming in the form of $RP (resource Points).</p>

							<h3>Collect Your Ships</h3>
							<p>Every month, shipyards and islands create vessels ($SHIPs) for the resistance cause. Each player's claimable $SHIP allotment are calculated at the beginning of each month and players can claim up to their alloted $SHIP count. <strong>Unclaimed ships will expire by the posting of the next calculation</strong>. $Ship calculations for each turn (month) are as follows (subject to change):
								<ul>
									<li>Each shipyard/Island will generate a base of 1 $SHIP</li>
									<li>Having a pair of shipard + Island will give you a synergy base bonus of 10 $SHIP for each pair you hold</li>
									<li>Governor Islands will grant governors 100 $ships </li>
									<li>Resistance Powerups when built will give an exclusive boost to owner of the powerup NFT and a general boost to all players</li>
									<li>Clan/Company powerups will give an exclusive boost to owner of the powerup NFT and all faction members</li>
									<li>Final ship outputs per player per turn are ROUNDED down to the nearest whole number</li>

										<br><i>***ENCRYPTED MESSAGE***</i> FIATland is looking for mercneary units to provide auxiliary security for a facility vital to the stability of the region.
