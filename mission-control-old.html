											<h2 class="major"><span>Welcome, Mercenary Captain.</span></h2>							
											<p>AVAXpelago has fallen to the FIATland foreign occupiers, the grand AVAX Navy has been destroyed in the final battle and the regional government has capitulated. AVAXpelago enters into a new chapter as the populace decides on whether they submit to the FIATland way of life or resist and work towards liberation. As a freelance captain, this is a prime time for you to make a fortune.
											</p> 
											<h2>About AVAX Navies: Islands of Resistance</h2>
											<p>AVAX Navies: Islands of Resistance is a combat simulation featuring Naval bases (ERC721 NFTs) and naval ships (ERC20 tokens) within the Islands of AVAX Ecosystem.
											Players construct shipyards on their islands and amass ships into their mercenary fleet. Participate in monthly missions with Prisoners Dilemma/Byzantine general logics.
											Join up with other players and start your own faction. Create your fortune in the FIATland occupied Archipelago region and become the master of the seas. 
											</p>
											<p>Battles are fought with $SHIP tokens which are generated every month based on the # of island and shipyards you have. Win missions to earn $RP, Resource Points, to power up your fleet, the resistance movement and make major breakthroughs against the FIATland occupation.
											</p>
											<p><i>AVAX Navies: Islands of Resistance is an authorized collaboration project of AVAX Navies (by Crypto Ed) with the Islands of AVAX ecosystem lore and intellectual properties by Blockpixel Labs.</i> 
											</p>
											<h2>Simulation Summary - TLDR</h2>
											Chapter 2 gameplay can be summarized into the following steps:
											<ul>
												<li><a href="#an-naval-yard">Check and claim <b>monthly</b> $SHIP allowance (RESISTANCE NAVALYARD)</a></li>
												<li><a href="#an-mission">Participate in monthly missions (MISSION CONTROL)</a></li>
												<li><a href="#an-blackmarket">Collect $RP before the end of each month (BLACK MARKET)</a></li>
												<li><a href="#an-hq">Build Resistance Facilities (RESISTANCE HQ)</a></li>

					<h2 class="major"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
					<div class="container">

						<button class="accordion">WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD BATTLE SYSTEM?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							The old battle system was clunky and relied heavily on discord, signing Kryptosign with wallets and conducting wallet scans. We worked hard to assemble an upgraded battle system with an actual UI and less reliant on Discord (Mission discussions are encouraged there.).</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT'S the relationship between Islands of AVAX and AVAX Navies?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Islands of Avax is the intellectual property of BlockPixel Labs. AVAX Navies is an independent authorized spinoff by the contractor who built the IoA website, Crypto Ed. Authorization has been granted by Blockpixel Labs to use Islands of AVAX NFTs within the battle system of AVAX Navies. AVAX Navies: Islands of Resistance is the next chapter of the battle system.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT HAPPENED TO Islands of AVAX PROJECT?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							AVAX Navies is independent from BlockPixel labs and is the creation of Crypto Ed. According to BlockPixels, IoA Development for the original Island simulation has encountered a roadblock with the sudden departure of their developer contractor as well as a drop in their yield on AAVE as a result of the 2022 bear market (The project is not allowed to dig into its principal and must live on yields). Instead of putting the project into limbo, Blockpixels requested to build a military simulation that will be worked into the economic simulation once a suitable developer can be brought onboard.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Why do turns take a whole month to occur?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Resistance is closer to a table top experience of Warhammer 40k or Dungeons and Dragons using prisoner dilemma/byzantine general concepts. We pride ourselves in our ever growing lore over as opposed to making a copy and paste farm/mint project.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Why are $SHIP and $RP CLAIMS ROUNDED DOWN?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							We have to use the tools available to us and are thankful to the folks at Third Web for providing us with a suite of mints and faucets. We plan to migrate to proprietary contracts once we bring on a CTO/full stack dev.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Why do my $SHIP allowance and $RP claims expire at the end of the month?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							We're at war with FIATland, any unused supply or equipment is taking up storage space. If you're not claiming them, someone else is. (Actual reason is we're working within the technical limits of the tools we're using. Hopefully with battle system 3.0, unclaimed $SHIP & $RP can be rolled over as we plan to develop proprietary contracts)</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT DO I DO WITH EXPIRED MISSION TOKENS?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							We're sorry to hear that your team did not win or you missed your window to exchange your mission token for $RP. We've given sufficient heads up for everyone to exchange their tokens before the end of each month. Since our $RP mint can only accept one token at a time, it's set to the token of last months' winner.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHY ARE THE MISSIONS NOT UPDATED YET?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Note that this is still a prototype simulation and some elements are manually calculated and updated. We try to have new allowances and rewards calculated within 2-3 days into each new month. Please check our <a href="https://twitter.com/islandsofavax">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://discord.islandsofavax.com">Discord</a> to know when new missions and allowances are up.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">CAN I TEAM UP WITH FRIENDS AND FORM A RAIDING PARTY?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Players are encouraged to form factions/companies and commit to missions options as a group. Faction based facilities may be available if factions are big enough which offers its faction members exclusive perks. Faction based missions may be possible if they're influential enough.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">HOW MUCH CAN I MAKE?</button>

							<strong>Note that AVAX NAVIES NFT series is first and foremost an artistic NFT collection and <u>not an investment or security of any form.</u></strong> 
							Players who participate in the simulation do so because they love the NFT arts and want to be part of the combat simulation that goes with it.

						<p>
							Chapter 3 is the story of a newly liberated AVAXpelago region. Players who contributed the most in chapter will have a major say in shaping the post FIAT AVAXpelago region from the type of nation(s) that will inhabit the archipelago region to the values and cultures of the people there. Chapter 3 will start once a simple economic model is set up.</p>
