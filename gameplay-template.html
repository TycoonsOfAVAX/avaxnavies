											<h2 class="major"><span>Welcome, Mercenary Captain | <a href="#header">[Return to Base]</a></span> </h2>				
											<p>AVAXpelago has fallen to the FIATland foreign occupiers, the grand AVAX Navy has been destroyed in the final battle and the regional government has capitulated. AVAXpelago enters into a new chapter as the populace decides on whether they submit to the FIATland way of life or resist and work towards liberation. As a freelance captain, this is a prime time for you to make a fortune.
											</p> 
											<h2>About AVAX Navies: Islands of Resistance</h2>
											<p>AVAX Navies: Islands of Resistance is a combat simulation featuring Naval bases (ERC721 NFTs) and naval ships (ERC20 tokens) within the Islands of AVAX Ecosystem.
											Players construct shipyards on their islands and amass ships into their mercenary fleet. Participate in monthly missions with Prisoners Dilemma/Byzantine general logics.
											Join up with other players and start your own faction. Create your fortune in the FIATland occupied Archipelago region and become the master of the seas. 
											</p>
											<p>Battles are fought with $SHIP tokens which are generated every month based on the # of island and shipyards you have. Win missions to earn $RP, Resource Points, to power up your fleet, the resistance movement and make major breakthroughs against the FIATland occupation.
											</p>
											<p><i>AVAX Navies: Islands of Resistance is an authorized collaboration project of AVAX Navies (by Crypto Ed) with the Islands of AVAX ecosystem lore and intellectual properties by Blockpixel Labs.</i> 
											</p>
											<h2>Simulation Summary - TLDR</h2>
											Chapter 2 gameplay can be summarized into the following steps:
											<ul>
												<li><a href="#an-naval-yard">Check and claim <b>monthly</b> $SHIP allowance (RESISTANCE NAVALYARD)</a></li>
												<li><a href="#an-mission">Participate in monthly missions (MISSION CONTROL)</a></li>

						<p>Things have changed a lot since then. The FIATland armada has moved on to the Abritrum and Optimism region leaving behind a modest garrison to oppress the population as part of their assimulation by force agenda. Resistance supporters in the Avaxpelago are secretly building a resistance fleet from decommissioned naval vessels and converted civilian ships built from <a href="https://avaxnavies.com">local shipyards</a> to support the resistance effort. Players can generate $SHIPs by staking, Island NFTs, Naval Base NFTs or Resistance Outpost NFTs. Ship construction rate are as follows (subject to change):</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Island NFT = 1 $SHIP per week</li>

									<p>It's time to deploy your $SHIPs on missions! Each month, a new mission will be unveiled in the form of either a PvE or PvP challenge. To participate, players will exchange their $SHIP tokens for a unique mission token (e.g., Mission 1 = $M1, Mission 2 = $M2, etc.) as proof of their involvement. 
										For PvE missions, all players will work together to meet a specific target (e.g., 500 $SHIPs committed before the end of the month) in order to unlock rewards. In contrast, PvP missions will feature multiple teams (each represented by a different mission token) for players to contribute their $SHIPs to. Only the teams that meet the designated threshold requirement will be eligible for rewards.     
										
										<h3>Collecting rewards</h3>
										The Proof of Participation system rewards players based on the size of their share of mission tokens. The larger the share, the greater the number of reward tokens that can be earned if the team successfully meets the mission requirements.
										Players who hold mission tokens that contribute to a successful mission can redeem them for Resource Points ($RP) at the <a href="#an-blackmarket">black market</a>.</p>

									<h2>Mission 1 - Operation Lockpick [Testnet]</h2>
									<p><b>Description:</b> 
										<br><u>RESISTANCE:</u>
										<br>The resistance movement is gaining momentum, but we need more fighters to bolster our ranks. Our intel has uncovered a re-education camp where AVAX natives are being coerced into adopting FIAT currency against their will. We need your help to infiltrate the facility and rescue these people from their captors.
										<br><u>FIATLAND:</u>
										<br><i>***ENCRYPTED MESSAGE***</i> FIATland is seeking the assistance of mercenary units to provide auxiliary security for a facility that is vital to the region's stability. While a small taskforce is currently active on the ground, your force will be on standby. Your ships will be deployed to aid the primary taskforce should they encounter any unforeseen complications beyond their capacity.</i>
									<br><b>Mission Type:</b> Winner takes all
									<br><b>Winning conditions:</b> Team with largest $SHIP count above minimum threshold wins it all
									<br><b>Threshold condition:</b> 100 $SHIPs 
									<br><b>Reward:</b> Winning team shares a pool 100-150$RP 
									</p>
									<h3>Commit your ships on mission (You can join both)</h3>
									To participate on each mission, you 'mint' the mission team tokens with your $SHIPs. Team token of the winning team can be traded for $RP at the <a href="#an-blackmarket">black market</a>.

														<br>AVAXpelago Navy's priority is to EVACUATE the civilian populations and set up a defensive position in the area before the expected arrival of FIATland fleet on May 1st. However, it is also noted that a lot of FIATland supplies can be LOOTed from the unprotected supply ships the sunken capital ship fleet was escorting.

														<br>Desperate for funding, FIATland is selling their Oil at a massive discount to keep their economy afloat. Despite an embargo from the international community on FIATland Oil, global Oil conglomerate, Oyster Oil Inc, recently bought a large order of oil from FIATland and are hiring smugglers and escort ships to dump onto the black markets. 
														While a little bit of oil being dumped into the market will not affect the market, too much Oil smuggled out and dumped onto the market will cause a short term OIL CRASH.

					<h2 class="major"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
					<div class="container">

						<button class="accordion">WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD BATTLE SYSTEM?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							The old battle system was clunky and relied heavily on discord, signing Kryptosign with wallets and conducting wallet scans. We worked hard to assemble an upgraded battle system with an actual UI and less reliant on Discord (Mission discussions are encouraged there.).</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT'S the relationship between Islands of AVAX and AVAX Navies?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Islands of Avax is the intellectual property of BlockPixel Labs. <br>
							AVAX Navies is an independent authorized spinoff using a white label <strong>Proof of Participation - Active Combat Engagement System</strong> (POP-ACES) built by Crypto Ed. <br>
							Authorization has been granted by Blockpixel Labs to use Islands of AVAX NFTs within POP-ACES.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT'S IS Proof of Participation - Active Combat Engagement System (POP-ACES)?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							POP-ACES is a revolutionary Proof of Participation combat system, developed by Crypto Ed to bring combat gameplay for EVM Based NFT collections. Unlike other play-to-earn games, POP-ACES requires players to be actively involved by staking their resources and tactically deploying battle tokens ($SHIPs in Islands of Resistance) across multiple fronts using Byzantine General and Prisoners Dilemna game logics.
							Players must collaborate as a team to accomplish mission objectives and earn rewards. This system incentivizes participation and teamwork, resulting in an immersive and engaging experience for all players.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT HAPPENED TO Islands of AVAX PROJECT?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							The Islands of AVAX project encountered a setback when their blockchain and UI developer left, coinciding with a drop in their yield on AAVE due to the 2022 bear market. Despite these challenges, BlockPixels Labs has decided not to abandon the project completely. Instead, they have given permission to Crypto Ed, the creator of AVAX Navies, to use the Islands of AVAX lore and staking permissions in their military simulation using a whitelabel version of POP-ACES. While the original Island simulation development is on hold, the partnership with Crypto Ed will ensure that players can still enjoy the immersive world of Islands of AVAX in a different form until the market stabilizes and development continues.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Why do turns take a whole month to occur?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Islands of Resistance is more like a table top experience Warhammer 40k or Dungeons and Dragons using prisoner dilemma/byzantine general concepts instead of a fast paced RTS game. We pride ourselves in our ever growing lore as opposed to making a copy and paste farm/mint project.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Why do my $SHIP allowance and $RP claims expire at the end of the month?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							We're at war with FIATland, any unused supply or equipment is taking up storage space. If you're not claiming them, someone else is. (Actual reason is we're working within the technical limits of the tools we're using. Hopefully with battle system 3.0, unclaimed $SHIP & $RP can be rolled over as we plan to develop proprietary contracts)</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT DO I DO WITH EXPIRED MISSION TOKENS?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							We're sorry to hear that your team did not win or you missed your window to exchange your mission token for $RP. We've given sufficient heads up for everyone to exchange their tokens before the end of each month. Since our $RP faucet can only accept one token at a time, it's set to the token of last months' winner.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEW MONTH WHY ARE THE MISSIONS NOT UPDATED YET?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Note that this is still a prototype simulation and some elements are manually calculated and updated. We try to have new allowances and rewards calculated within 2-3 days into each new month. Please check our <a href="https://twitter.com/islandsofavax">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://discord.islandsofavax.com">Discord</a> to know when new missions and allowances are up.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">CAN I TEAM UP WITH FRIENDS AND FORM A RAIDING PARTY?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Players are encouraged to form factions/companies and participate on PvP mission options as a group. Faction exclusive missions may be available to the more influential factions where the faction can claim a % if not all of the cycle's reward allowance if they meet mission requirements (Higher than other standard teams).</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">HOW MUCH CAN I MAKE?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							<strong>Note that AVAX NAVIES NFT series is first and foremost an artistic NFT collection and <u>not an investment or security of any form.</u></strong> 
							Players who participate in the simulation do so because they love the NFT arts and want to be part of the combat simulation that goes with it. 
							One should not be expecting to make any returns from this experience. 
						</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">WHAT IS CHAPTER 3 ABOUT? WHEN DO WE START CHAPTER 3?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						<p>
							Chapter 3 is the story of a newly liberated AVAXpelago region. Players who contributed the most in chapter will have a major say in shaping the post FIAT AVAXpelago region from the type of nation(s) that will inhabit the archipelago region to the values and cultures of the people there. Chapter 3 will start once a simple economic model is set up.</p>
